# LSDRF
Landslide detection using Random Forest model.
This python code takes satellite images and slope factor as input for landslide detection.
Random Forest model is used as predictor model for mapping landslides.each section is expalined, so it is easy to run,
however you can customize the traning-testing and model parameters.
this the first version, and my first python project.
