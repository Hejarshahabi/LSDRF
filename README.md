# LSDRF
Landslide detection using Random Forest model.
This python code takes satellite images and slope factor as input for landslide detection.
Random Forest model is used as predictor model for mapping landslides.each section is expalined, so it is easy to run,
however you can customize the traning-testing and model parameters.
this code is based on Python=3.6, and in order to run it properly it is highly recommended
to install the GDAL version that matches your installed Python. 
Pyrsgis is another library that is used in this project to read, write and sotre satellite images, and can be easly installed by "pip install 
pyrsgis", but it needs GDAL to be executed.
this the first version, and my first python project.
